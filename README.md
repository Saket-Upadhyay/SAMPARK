> NOTE: This SAMPARK prototype (v4.0) was initially created by [Saket Upadhyay](https://github.com/Saket-Upadhyay) and [Oorja Rungta](https://github.com/OorjaRungta) as a hackathon entry for HackCoVIT'20. 
> Now it's undertaken by "Google Developer Student Club (DSC) VIT Bhopal" (on 11th Jan. 2021) for further development of the concept, under "Web Development and Security" Team.

> **Further development can be tracked on [DSCVITBHOPAL/SAMPARK](https://github.com/DSCVITBHOPAL/SAMPARK).**
> We might update it here too if it's okay with DSC's community guidelines.

##### Problem Statement HackCoVIT 2020 
Recently, online operations  aiming at end-customers  are  relying  more  on web-based  services. Many  fake  e-commerce  websites  might  claim to  sell the  products  which  are  currently  unavailable  elsewhere.  Considering  the overall growing amounts of unaware end-users, we can see more security holes  and  easy  opportunities  for  cybercriminals.  For  example:  as  people can't  go  out  to  buy  daily  necessities  they  rely  on  e-commerce  websites which may lead them to use unknown/less trustworthy sources which can force them to make the financial processes online. This will help criminals to  steal  your  credit  card  number,  PIN,  and  security  code  to  make unauthorized transactions, without needing your physical credit card. Make software  that  helps  prevent these  credit  card  frauds  and  warns  the  user before they make transactions online.
